                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                    <p>Where does it come from? <br>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
                        cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
                        from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
                    <p>Why do we use it?<br>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it
                        has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                        here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
                        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
                        uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                    <p>Where can I get some?<br>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
                        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which
                        don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need
                        to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
                        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first
                        true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a
                        handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
                        generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                        non-characteristic words etc.</p>
